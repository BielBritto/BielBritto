- 👋 Hi, I’m @BielBritto
- 👀 I’m interested in compartilhar my projects and knowledge, in addition to learning from the community and interacting, so that I can evolve in the middle of programming and help other people to evolve.
- One area I'm interested in learning about, is the back-end part of game programming.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C e C++ hrough the Systems Engineering Course, but looking to learn other languages on the outside.
- I have facility in the area of Mathematics and Logical Reasoning and desire to work with programming that involves these skills.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with my mathematical knowledge and ability to solve problems that require logical reasoning, after all, whoever teaches/helps, always ends up learning a lot too.
